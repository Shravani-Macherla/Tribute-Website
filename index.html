                    <h2>Netaji Prince of Patriots</h2>
                    <p>
                    Subhash Chandra Bose was an Indian freedom fighter born on 23rd January 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa in the Province of Bengal. He was also referred to as “Netaji” meaning the “leader” in Hindi. The honorific was given to him in Germany in 1942 by the German soldiers of an Indian legion.
<br>
Netaji was two times elected President of the Indian National Congress, firstly from; 18 January 1938 to 28 January 1939 and secondly from 29 January 1939 to 29 April 1939. His second term as the President was brief, ranging only for three months as he has to resign due to differences of opinion with Mahatma Gandhi.
<br>
Netaji was a true patriot and advocated complete independence without any conditions and obligations. He opined that freedom obtained on the conditions of the British, will be harmful to the progress of the nation.
<br>
Finding no political support for his ideology in India, Netaji, escaped to Germany in 1941. There he met Adolf Hitler, the commander of the German armed forces and was successful in obtaining the latter’s support.

<br>

An attempt by Netaji to oust British out of Indian soil with the help of German forces under the commandership of Adolf Hitler was questioned by many historians and political thinkers. They believed that after the victory, Germans would be unlikely to leave the Indian soil, thereby, resulting in an axis victory.
<br>
Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose died on 18th August 1945, in a plane crash in the Japanese ruled Taiwan. The ashes of Netaji have been preserved in a Buddhist temple “Renkoji Temple” in Tokyo, Japan.
